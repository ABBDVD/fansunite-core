# Fansunite Core

Fansunite Core defines a protocol to facilitate trustless wagering of any ERC20 token for any sport events. The resolution of wagers and the provision of event data is crowd-sourced by a decentralized network of oracles incentivised to provide low-latency and accurate sports data. The FansUnite protocol will serve as the building blocks for decentralized applications (DApps) that span traditional bookmaking, betting exchanges, and a variety of other services reliant on sports data.
